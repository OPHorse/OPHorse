Hello There ðŸ‘‹
I dabble in the arts of lua, javascript, html and the very painful world of css (css is painful)
I just started programming, I have created little projects but nothing too good (very nice quality control... just enough...)

If you wanted to contact me for some reason (please... my inbox is pratically a black hole)
